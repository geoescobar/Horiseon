# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Changes Made

At the beginning in the the title I changed the name from website to Horiseon. Reason behind that was to give the tab an accurate title of what page you're on. 

Moving forward I created a header tag to wrap all of the header elements into an easier to locate and understand place. Within that header tag I also included a nav tag for the UL containing links. 

Once I moved onto the content I created 2 sections. One section for the main content containing: search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. On the images there was a missing piece to the div for the first image. It was missing an ID so I included that as well to match the rest of the code. 

I then created another section for the column containgin: lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. 

Finally at the bottom of the page I added a footer tag. Within the footer tag I changed the h element to an h4 to be semantic with the rest of the page as we had already  used h1,h2, and h3. 

These are all the changes I did to the html to make it semantic!
